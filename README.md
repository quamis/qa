v1+v2


depends on 
	-
	
next optimizations:
	x use xorsum to reduce the number of false-positives
	- use threads/processes (Pool) - limited to the number of CPU cores, and a process-manager would be needed
	- use C/C++/PyPy+CFFI
	- use OpenCL - it doesn't support recursive functions, so a non-resursive algorithm would have to be implemented
